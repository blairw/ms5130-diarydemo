**Problem statement:**

When attempting to run R code that calls on the `leaflet` package, the following error occurred as per @fig-no-leaflet-found below:

![No package called `leaflet`?](images/no-leaflet-found.png){#fig-no-leaflet-found width=80%}


**Solution statement:**

In order to investigate further, I scrolled through the console output in RStudio. The following part of the console output drew my attention, even though I do not fully understand it, as depicted in @fig-gdcal-config below.

![Something wrong with `gdal-config`?](images/gdal-config.png){#fig-gdcal-config width=80%}

I have never heard of `gdal-config` before, so I performed a Google search for "gdal-config", which directed me to [Stack Overflow #12141422](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12141422/error-gdal-config-not-found-while-installing-r-dependent-packages-whereas-gdal):

One of the posts on that thread, [#57986572](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57986572), suggested that it is necessary on macOS to install `gdal` at the level of the operating system, using Homebrew, i.e., `brew install gdal`. I therefore performed that step; however, I then received a similar error message about `proj` missing, which prompted me to perform a similar search about `proj`, taking me to Stack Overflow [#30034372](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30034372), which advised me to similarly install `proj` using Homebrew. So, I performed the following overall installation of packages using Homebrew:

```zsh
brew install gdal proj
```

At this stage, however, I continued to experience problems with Leaflet in RStudio even though I installed the required underlying packages. The error message that I received was as follows: _"error: libproj or sqlite3 not found in standard or given locations"_.

I performed a Google Search for that exact error message, which took me to a discussion thread on GitHub, [#1894 on r-spatial/sf](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1894). The solution was revealed by the user **pat-s** (see [their comment here](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf/issues/1894#issuecomment-1025559431)), who advised a customised version of `install.packages(...)` in RStudio, as follows:

```r
install.packages("terra", type = "source", configure.args = c("--with-sqlite3-lib=/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlite/lib", "--with-proj-lib=/opt/homebrew/opt/proj/lib"))

install.packages("leaflet", type = "source", configure.args = c("--with-sqlite3-lib=/opt/homebrew/opt/sqlite/lib", "--with-proj-lib=/opt/homebrew/opt/proj/lib"))
```

Now, once I performed all required steps in both Homebrew and RStudio, it all works!

To contribute to the open-source community using Leaflet in Quarto/RStudio, I made my findings available to the public on GitHub here: https://github.com/blairw/docs-leaflet-rstudio-macos

A happy ending! ðŸ˜Š
